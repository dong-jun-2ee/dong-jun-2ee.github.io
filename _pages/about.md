Currently, I am working at [MaumAI](https://maum.ai) as an Artificial Intelligence Scientist. My responsibilities include fine-tuning large language models to align with specific business objectives.

Previously, I conducted my research under the supervision of [Prof. Jaekwang Kim](https://dramatic-samba-372.notion.site/Jaekwang-KIM-b5955ec7d50f488b8ff7bd29f9148641) as a graduate researcher at the [MainLab](https://mainlab.skku.edu) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU).  My academic journey in artificial intelligence began in February 2022 when I started my Masterâ€™s degree at Sungkyunkwan University.

My research interests primarily lie in three areas: (1) recommendation systems, (2) generative models, and (3) large language models, though I remain open to broader topics within the field. The core focus of my work is enhancing user personalization and experience, guided by the ethos of `"Making the World a Better Place."` As I work toward this vision, I am seeking opportunities with forward-thinking groups or teams where I can apply my expertise in machine learning and deep learning to make meaningful contributions to our shared future.

If you are interested in collaboration or have any inquiries, please feel free to reach out.
